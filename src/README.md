# rs-webmark
A very minimal static site generator that converts Markdown to HTML files.

## Use case
While developing my website, I went from a `C# .NET Core` implementation, then a `C++` implementation.
They included the full ordeal of features:

* Managing articles (CRUD)
* Users (for comments)
* Categories

In the end, I simply noted that, what I really wanted was a static website for I have no use for all those features. So I started doing the `HTML` pages manually.

After documenting my trip to Japan I noticed how tiresome it was to write the markup manually and how each page were basically structure similarly.

### Markdown to the rescue
I personnally enjoy the [Markdown-Preview Enhanced](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced) for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) which works flawlessly to take notes, so I decided to use markdown for the purpose of my website.

Of course, some static site generator already exists, such as:
* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) - Very complete but seems overwhelming for my use case.
* [Cobalt](https://cobalt-org.github.io/) - Pretty close to what I want but again, where's the fun if I cannot do it from scratch* myself ? :)

## Disclaimer
I wouldn't recommend this for production use. This is mostly my own little project I cannot guarantee that I'll support even if my website is built on it.
